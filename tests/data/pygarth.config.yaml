# Files to use for comparison.
# Using the Path.rglob() command.
filename_patterns:
  - "*.out"
  - "*.sample"

# Some filenames change from run to run and this
# provides an option to generalize the output names.
filename_substitutions:
  - original_filename: "[0-9]{4}"
    replacement_filename: "0000" 

# Provides a list of regular expression replacements
# during the file comparison. Useful for things that
# might change from one test execution to another like...
# - time
# - user name
# - execution paths
# - version numbers
text_substitutions:
  - original_text: ""
    replacement_text: ""

# Folder containing the expected outputs
expected_folder: ""

# Location and pattern for the instruction set of the code.
# The input files are then used in the 'execution_command' to 
# replace the "$INPUT" argument.
instruction_set_folder: ""

# Command used to run the program under test.
execution_command: "/path/to/code -i $INPUT"
