# Files to use for comparison.
# Using the Path.rglob() command.
filename_patterns:
  - "*.out"
  - "*.sample"

# Some filenames change from run to run and this
# provides an option to generalize the output names.
filename_substitutions:
  - original_filename: "[0-9]{4}"
    replacement_filename: "0000" 

# Provides a list of regular expression replacements
# during the file comparison. Useful for things that
# might change from one test execution to another like...
# - time
# - user name
# - execution paths
# - version numbers
text_substitutions:
  - original_text: ""
    replacement_text: ""

# Reference
# - Compares an output directory with a reference directory.
# - The structure of the two directories should be the same.
# Expected
# - Compares files inside a directory using "*.gold" file endings to mark
#   files that are the expected results.
comparison_style: "reference | expected"

# Only needed when 'comparison_style = reference'
# so the tool knows where to look for expected results.
